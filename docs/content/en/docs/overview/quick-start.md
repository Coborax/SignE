## Requirements
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) â€” .NET 6.0 LTS

<!--{{< details "Why Node.js?" >}}
Doks uses npm (included with Node.js) to centralize dependency management, making it [easy to update]({{< relref "how-to-update" >}}) resources, build tooling, plugins, and build scripts.

## Start a new SignE Game project

**Attention.**
At the moment the editor does not support creating new projects,

```bash
dotnet new console --name MyAwesomeGame && cd MyAwesomeGame
```

```bash

```
